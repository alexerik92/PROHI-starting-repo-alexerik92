During my Data Science course, I worked on a project focused on obesity. 
    The dataset used captured key attributes related to eating habits,
             physical activity, and health status, containing 2,111 records and 17 features. 
            Each entry was labeled under the NObesity class variable, which categorizes individuals into
             seven levels: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight I, Overweight II, Obesity I, Obesity II, 
            and Obesity III. About 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform, 
            while the remaining 77% was synthetically generated using the SMOTE filter in Weka to ensure balanced 
            class distribution. As part of preprocessing, variables were cleaned and renamed for better clarity. 
            Following this, I explored analytical questions to uncover trends and patterns within the data and 
            developed predictive models to classify individuals across different obesity levels. 
            This combination of analysis and modeling provided valuable insights into obesity-related risk factors.
